&#x270D;&#xFE0F; *Key points:*

&#x1F50D; Data visualization is an important analysis and exploration tool

&#x1F4CA; Beautiful figures efficiently tell the story of your research. Most people only ever look at the figures of your papers, for the others it's the first thing they look at.

&#x1F9EA; Reduce. Refine. And make it self-explanatory.

&#x1f967; Don't use pie charts.

&#x1F308; Don't overdo colors and use [colorblind-friendly palettes][colors].
